The project started out with us connecting on discord, similar to the last project, while the work we did was pushed to github to share. We ran the projects on our personal clients and communicated our intentions through discord to get the project done. I helped on the project by researching on the AbstractList class to help Harold and Lakashhar write it and I wrote the ListClient test with Aayush and Lakashhar, which helped to display the final result to see if everything was working.
